# TO DO LIST PROJECT ES6
This repo is created to contains to do list project files. In this project I used ES6.

## Overview

In this project, we built a basic website that allows users to prepare to do list. This was achieved by using JavaScript objects and arrays, while using javascript DOM and basic events to dynamically modify the page.

## Project Tasks List

- [x] Remove all hardcoded items from the tasks array.
- [x] Create a new JavaScript file for the new functionality.
- [x] Implement a function for adding a new task (add a new element to the array).
- [x] Implement a function for deleting a task (remove an element from the array).
- [x] Implement a function for editing task descriptions.
- [x] By default new tasks should have the property completed set to false and the property index set to the value of the new array length (i.e. if you're adding a 5th task to the list, the index of that task should equal to 5).
- [x] Deleting a task should update all remaining items' indexes, so they represent the current list order and are unique(i.e. if you're deleting the first task index 1 from the list, the index of the next task(2) should set to 1)..
- [x] All changes to the To Do List should be saved in local storage.
