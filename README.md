# TO DO LIST PROJECT ES6
This repo is created to contains to do list project files. In this project I used ES6.

## Overview

In this project, we built a basic website that allows users to prepare to do list. This was achieved by using JavaScript objects and arrays, while using javascript DOM and basic events to dynamically modify the page.

## Project Tasks List

- [x]  Add a new JavaScript file and import it as a module:
- [x] it will contain methods related to the status updates (completed: true / false).
- [x] Add event listener to the checkbox (change).
- [x] Update items object's value for completed key upon user actions.
- [x] Implement a function for the "Clear all completed" button (use filter() method).
- [x] Store the updated array of items in local storage, so the user gets the correct list values after the page reloads.
